Why
  * I wanted to do something with
    * cryptography and education
  * rather than making a secure messenger app which has been done and done again. I wanted to make something that would have a more lasting impact on people. I saw a need for educating people around the kind of data that can be collected on them and the potential uses of that data.  I want to do this because I think that many people are mostly unaware of what information they may be giving up and to what ends and I think that we all deserve to make more informed choices when we consume digital media.

Intro
* Hi there my name is Clark Walker
* I'm a full-stack software developer
* Technology is a recent interest for me I wasn't interested in computers beyond video games at all until about 2012 I was 24, I grew up playing music with my Mom and step-Dad and while I was always intellectually curious I thought I couldn't do academic things.  I taught myself a lot of music theory
